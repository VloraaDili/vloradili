        <h4 class="News1"> Deciding on a new fragrance has always been a deeply personal choice.
            There are, of course,<br> several elements that come into play when selecting a scent you love.
            The nostalgia component<br> when choosing certain notes factors in greatly—and we've all 
            learned that fragrance usually<br> needs an hour or two to settle onto your skin to properly
             smell the way it's intended to, based on your personal body chemistry.<br><br><br><br>

            <h9 class="The-title">Dior Advert Calendar</h9> <br><br>
            
        <h class="news-2">For the Dior Advent Calendar, artist Alice Shirley created an enchanting floral world
            of midnight blue foliage  and golden winter buds that come to life like a stage performance
            when the curtain rises. Between luminous petals and armfuls of extraordinary flowers fly 
            bees and butterflies as colorful as they are marvelous.
            This holiday season, step into a luxuriant garden with a thousand and one fanciful flowers:
            on the doorstep and behind the walls of 30 Avenue Montaigne, magic blooms
            within the Dior Atelier of dreams.  <br><br> 
        
            <h class="The-title">CHANEL Advert Calendar</h> <br><br>

            <h class="news-2">To celebrate the holiday season and mark 100 years of the legendary fragrance,
            CHANEL presents a first-of-its-kind calendar crafted in the timeless silhouette of the N°5
            flacon. Count down to the holidays with this collector's item featuring 27 boxes numbered
            from 5 to 31, filled with mysterious delights and surprises. A piece to treasure for years to come.

            <h class="The-title">Liberty London Advert Calendar</h> <br><br>

            <h class="news-2"> It's no coincidence that this calendar is Liberty London's fastest selling product every year;
            it's positively packed with cult favorite beauty products and the hottest new launches from brands like Olaplex,
            Augustinus Bader, Davines, and 111Skin. And, since you won't want to share, they've even developed a men's version too.

        <p4 class="launch">
            If you're a fan of YSL's floral perfume,
            you need to check out the luxurious limited-edition
            Libre Eau De Parfum. The perfume is a reinvention of
            the classic, combining lavender with Moroccan orange
            blossom to create a beautiful floral scent with a hint
            of musk accord. Plus, think about how damn luxurious 
            this will look on your vanity.

        <p4 class="launch">
            The degrees are droppin' and this starry night bottle
             is the perfect ode to those chilly winter nights.
             If you're not much of a warm-kind-of-scent person, 
             this refreshing citrus and sweet perfume is reminiscent
              of the Pacific Coast breeze.
